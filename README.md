Repository with source code for solving hierarchical task specifications:

Unholy undocumented mess at the moment.

Refactoring and documentation coming soon!



Duality trick reformulation:

The source code for duality trick reformulation of the lexicographic linear program into a single objective linear program can be found in the duality trick folder. To run this file, MATLAB and Yalmip toolbox needs to be installed. To reproduce the computational performance reported in the paper, it is also recommended to install Gurobi which provides a free academic license.

There is also an undocumented implementation of the duality trick also for hierarchical quadratic programming.
